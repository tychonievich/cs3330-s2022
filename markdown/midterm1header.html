<ul>
<li>Time limit: 75 minutes.</li>
<li>No notes, books, or calculators. Scratch paper is allowed.</li>
<li>Because the test is given in multiple locations, we cannot answer questions about the test during the test. If you find a question ambiguous or confusing, explain that on the page near the question and it will be considered during grading.</li>
<li>Grading occurs in gradescope, which shows one question to the grader at a time. Keep your comments and answers near the question they apply to.</li>
<li>You may use pencil or pen, and may mark answers in any way a human grader can easily understand.</li>
<li>Please write clearly. Ambiguous answers, such as
<span style="font-family:sans-serif">Ŧ</span>
when
<span style="font-family:sans-serif">T</span>
or
<span style="font-family:sans-serif">F</span>
was expected, are graded as wrong.</li>
<li>Partial credit is awarded for answers that demonstrate partial understanding.</li>
<li>Grading is not linear: earning 50% of the available points may result in more than a 50% grade on the test.</li>
<li>Unless otherwise specified in a specific question, assume that <code>int</code> is 32-bits, <code>long</code> and all pointers are 64-bits, and memory is little-endian.</li>
<li>For your reference:

<ul>
<li>2<sup>10</sup> is abbreviated "K" or "Ki" (kilo)</li>
<li>2<sup>20</sup> is abbreviated "M" or "Mi" (mega)</li>
<li>2<sup>30</sup> is abbreviated "G" or "Gi" (giga)</li>
<li>2<sup>40</sup> is abbreviated "T" or "Ti" (tera)</li>
<li>2<sup>50</sup> is abbreviated "P" or "Pi" (peta)</li>
<li>2<sup>60</sup> is abbreviated "E" or "Ei" (exa)</li>
<li>byte or octet is abbreviated "B"</li>
<li>a "cold cache" is one with no data (i.e. all lines are invalid)</li>
<li>in assembly,

<ul>
<li>the order is <code>operation, source, destination</code></li>
<li><code>123(%rax, %rbx, 8)</code> means the memory address <code>123 + rax + (8 * rbx)</code></li>
<li>there are has three shift operations: <code>sar</code> for signed <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, <code>shr</code> for unsigned <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, and <code>shl</code> for <code>&lt;&lt;=</code>; they have 64-, 32-, 16- and 8-bit versions like other operations (<code>shlq</code>, <code>shll</code>, and so on)</li>
<li><code>cmp X,Y</code> sets the flags as if comparing the result of <code>Y -= X</code> to 0</li>
<li><code>jg</code> and <code>jl</code> do signed-integer comparisons; <code>ja</code> and <code>jb</code> do unsigned-integer comparisons</li>
</ul></li>
