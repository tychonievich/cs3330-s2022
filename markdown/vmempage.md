title: Tracing Virtual Memory
...

In this lab and its homework pair you be given the contents of RAM and parse it by hand the way the virtual memory system in a computer would.

# Overview

Visit <https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cs3330/memhw/>

You will be presented with 512 bytes representing the entirety of physical memory,
together with some additional information about the page table, page table entries, etc.

Your task is to parse the memory and answer a set of 9 questions about this memory.

You can submit as often as you like. If you submit a mix of blank fields and correct answers, you will be able to continue with the same memory. But to prevent guess-and-check, if you submit an *incorrect* (but non-blank) answer too many times, memory will be changed and you'll have to work through the answer with the new contents of memory.

## Lab

You may work with others in your lab on problems 1, 2, and 7 of your page.
Note that no two of you will have the same contents of memory, but the process of understanding yours *and* another students will definitely help you on the homework.

## Homework

You should work on your own to finish the remaining items (3, 4, 5, 8, and 9).
